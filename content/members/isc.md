## Superior PKI Tools

ISC has helped organizations of all sizes deploy and effectively utilize traditional X.509 PKI solutions. ISC software components provide the foundational building blocks for many enterprise-wide, zero-trust security initiatives. Going forward, ISC is fully committed to help ease customers through the post-quantum transition.

Among ISC's partners are DoD integrators that embed our lifecycle management solutions as the foundations of trust for tactical battlefield communications stacks. These products facilitate personnel and NPE identification, transparent message encryption/authentication, and the protection and validation of command and control operations in real time. 

## Brief Corporate History

ISC gained recognition in the early 90’s for developing the first commercial implementations of the DSA and SHA algorithms, schemes adopted by NIST as mandatory government standards for sender and message authentication (FIPS 186 and FIPS 180-1).

The popular **SecretAgent** encryption utility debuted in 1991 and was followed by a certified DoD PKI-compliant release in 1999. SecretAgent supports X.509 certificates and CRLs from all leading commercial CAs to ensure data confidentiality/integrity, originator authentication, and (optionally) transparent encryption. Today this product is widely used throughout the U.S. Federal Government as well as by numerous Fortune 100 corporations.

In 1998, ISC developed a “software FORTEZZA” solution for NSA: a version of SecretAgent that supported MSP version 1 certificates, the NIST EES (“Skipjack”) for bulk encryption, and the DoD-classified KEA algorithm for key exchange. That year NSA demonstrated the product at a TechNet conference, showing it to be fully interoperable with the CAPSTONE-based FORTEZZA card.

In the last two decades, ISC has focused on the development of a host of *certificate lifecycle management applications* and *cryptographic web services*, while continuing to enhance SecretAgent (the latest iteration of which includes transparent, rule-based file protection and enterprise-scaleable, centralized configuration and management features). **CertAgent**, an affordable, fully-functional X.509 certificate authority first released in 2001, was the first CA to appear on the NSA CSfC approved components list and was recently awarded NIAP Common Criteria certification for the second time. PQC-enabled prototypes of CertAgent and SecretAgent are available for experimentation.
